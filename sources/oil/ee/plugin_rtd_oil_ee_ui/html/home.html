RT-Druid code generation using xslt file.
<p>
A new  xslt writer is defined by a list of xslt files and a 
description of interconnection among xslt files. Infact, the result of 
conversion done by one xslt can be the input for the next xslt tranformation.
More over, more than one transformation can be done on the same input; results
are agregated just before the end of the writer.
